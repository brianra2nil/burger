Do you love Burgers, and love trying new burgers?

This app let's you type in the name of the burgers you want to try.  Once you have tried them, click on Devour it to add them to the list of burgers you have devoured.  There is an option to delete from the list with the delete button.  The list will be saved the next time you want to return and update.
